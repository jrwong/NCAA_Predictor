NCAA_Predictor
==============
NCAA tournament bracket stuff

What I have so far:
findTie.py: takes in individual data sets of rankings for tournament teams for that specific year, puts it in a dictionary, and if you want puts it into a csv file.
current problems: have to manually input csv files for each category
	team names don’t match up
	
	
What I want:
a python program that takes in the fullrankings csv file and outputs the rankings of all the tournament teams for each category in a new csv file
another python program that takes the tournament results and makes it usable
another program that ultimately outputs correlation with wins and higher rankings in a certain category.

ultimately, I’d like to do some sort of machine learning thing where it takes previous year’s data and puts more weights on certain categories
